CP2K test calculations for GFP-wt monomer

#### The GFP system has been minimzed and equilibrated and the qmmm-*.inp files should run the QM/MM calculations #####
####
SCALE QM SUBSYSTEM (MM: 28264 atoms)
test-1:	20 atoms (SYG)
test-2: 32 atoms (SYG + ARG96)
test-3: 53 atoms (SYG + ARG96 + HID148 + GLU222)
test-4: 77 atoms (SYG + ARG96 + HID148 + GLU222 + SER205 + GLN94 + THR203 )


####### Each GFP system was started from the same initial structure but with a differnt BOX size ######
####### Each test run requires a separate EM, NVT, NPT runs before the QM/MM step. The equilibrated ### 
#######  box size after NPT equilibration can be picked up from the file NP-1.cell and should be ######
####### added to the qmmm input file               #####
SCALE MM 
test-1: 30928 atoms 
test-2: 51034 atoms 
test-3: 112498 atoms
test-4: 297610 atoms
