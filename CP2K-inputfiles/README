CP2K test calculations for GFP-wt monomer

#### The GFP system has been minimzed and equilibrated and the qmmm-*.inp files should run the QM/MM calculations #####
####
SCALE QM SUBSYSTEM (MM: 28264 atoms)
test-1:	20 atoms (SYG)
test-2: 32 atoms (SYG + ARG96)
test-3: 53 atoms (SYG + ARG96 + HID148 + GLU222)
test-4: 77 atoms (SYG + ARG96 + HID148 + GLU222 + SER205 + GLN94 + THR203 )


####### For scaling MM size each GFP system was started from the same initial structure but with a differnt BOX size ######
#######Separate minimization and equilibration runs before the QM/MM step. The equilibrated box size after NPT equilibration 
can be picked up from the file NPT-1.cell and should be added to the CELL definition in qmmm input file          #####
SCALE MM SIZE
test-1: 30928 atoms 
test-2: 51034 atoms 
test-3: 112498 atoms

Inputfiles have been updated such that all run with 5 time steps and LSD is disabled for all tests. The original 
inputfiles (if applicable) can be found in the orig/ directory with a README describing any changes made.
