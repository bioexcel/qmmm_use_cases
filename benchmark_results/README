This directory contains the benchmark results from the QM/MM test cases

The Excel spreadsheet contains the processed results from the raw data where the best runtime from 3 runs 
for each configuration was used. 

The spreadsheet also contains an estimate of the number of steps needs to keep startup 
costs below 5% of the total runtime and some experiments re. performance with and without LSD. 

The get_qmmm_timings.sh script can be used to extract the "best" result and start-up cost for each configuration
tested. The script generates a csv type file with name = [QM/MM]-test-[1/2/3/4].txt containing 10 columns containing: 
Nodes cores  CP2K runtime in seconds (on 1,2,4 and 6 threads, CP2K Startup time in seconds (on 1,2,4 & 6 threads). 
The .txt files for the largest and smallest QM and MM tests are included - the same data is also in the Excel 
spreadsheet. 

The raw_output/ directory contains all the results from multiple runs of the benchmarks on 
different numbers of nodes on ARCHER along with some testing of runs with and without LSD enabled.
